To install:

1) Check you have gpg, md5sum, sha1sum and shred installed and that you
   have created a key (gnupg and coreutils packages under GNU/Debian)
2) Make sure the supplied scripts are executable (chmod u+x gpg*)

When any of the scripts is first run, it will generate an rc
file in your home directory called .gpgutils.  This can be customised
as required.  Additionally, the placing of a .gpgutils file in any
directory will override this when the scripts are run from the given
directory.

The latest version of gpgutils can always be found at
